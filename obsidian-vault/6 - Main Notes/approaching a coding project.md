# 🧠 Approaching a Project

It can be difficult to know how to approach a project.

You’ve read resources and tried some examples, and now it’s time to apply what you know.  
**Where do you start?**  
The following framework can help you focus how you approach a project.

## 🔁 Step-by-Step Framework

1. **Read the task or challenge.**
2. **Rephrase** it in your own words.
3. **Verify expected behavior** by getting example inputs and outputs.
4. **Whiteboard your solution with words.**
5. **Walk through your solution with an example as if you were a machine.**
    - Do only what is written down.
    - Correct your solution if needed.
6. **Whiteboard your solution with pseudocode.**
7. **Walk through your pseudocode with an example.**
    - Again, do only what is written down.
    - Correct your pseudocode if needed.
8. **Whiteboard your solution with real code (on paper or board).**
9. **Walk through the code with an example.**
    - Simulate it like a machine.
    - Correct your code logic if necessary.
10. **Write your code on your computer.**
    > 💡 *This is the first time you are using your computer! Only start when you know exactly what to code.*
11. **Test your code on your computer.**
12. **Debug if necessary.**
13. ✅ **You complete the task or challenge!**

## 🔨 Pro Tips

- Break your task or project into **smaller and smaller pieces** until you’re confident solving each one.
- During **Step 10** ("Write your code on your computer"):
  - Code **one piece at a time**.
  - **Debug immediately** after each small step.
  - This helps avoid debugging multiple parts at once — making your life **much easier**!

📌 *Keep this framework handy when starting any coding challenge or project. Confidence comes with structure!*
