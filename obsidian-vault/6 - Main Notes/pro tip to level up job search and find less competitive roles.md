# pro tip to level up job search and find less competitive roles

**![:arrow_right:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/27a1-fe0f.png)** **Did you know that many Tech Jobs Aren’t on LinkedIn? Here’s How to Find Them!**If you’ve been relying only on LinkedIn or job boards like Indeed, you might be missing out on a **huge part of the job market,** especially in tech.Here’s a **_pro tip_** to level up your job search and find **less competitive** roles:**![:bulb:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4a1.png)** **The Hidden Job Market: What You Need to Know:**![:small_blue_diamond:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f539.png) **Many companies don’t post jobs on LinkedIn,** especially startups or fast-growing companies. **Why?**

- Posting on LinkedIn is expensive
- Most companies already pay for tools like Greenhouse, Lever, or Workday (called **Applicant Tracking Systems – ATS**) to manage job listings internally.
- These jobs are live but often only on **company career pages** – not job boards.
- Some companies hire through **referrals**, **direct sourcing**, or **private talent networks** before the job is ever listed publicly.

![:bulb:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4a1.png) **Google Search Hack: Find Jobs Directly from Company Career Pages**You can use Google to search job listings directly from these platforms using the `site:` operator.![:white_check_mark:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705.png) **Try this format** on Google:

site:boards.greenhouse.io ("backend engineer" OR "fullstack developer") AND "remote"

![:white_check_mark:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705.png) **Other common platforms to search:**

- `site:jobs.lever.co`
- `site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com`
- `site:wd1.myworkdayjobs.com`
- `site:jobs.bamboohr.com`
- `site:jobs.jobvite.com`
- `site:careers.icims.com`
- `site:apply.jazz.co`
- `site:careers.workable.com`

![:pushpin:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4cc.png) **Use job titles, locations, keywords, and Boolean operators:**

- `"senior backend engineer"` AND `"Berlin"`
- `"UX designer"` OR `"product designer"` OR `"UI/UX researcher"` AND `"remote"`

![:brain:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f9e0.png) **Boolean logic = big power!**

- AND = must include both terms
- OR = either/or
- "quotes" = exact phrase
- (parentheses) = group logic

![:white_check_mark:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705.png) **Why This Works****Direct Access** – See listings the moment they’re posted  
**Less Competition** – Fewer candidates know or use this method  
**More Relevant** – You tailor what you see with keywords**Google Search Limit**Keep your search short! Google has limits:  

- **32 words**
- **2048 characters**

Stick to focused, clean searches.Some Jobs Aren’t Posted Anywhere.That’s right. Some high-impact roles (especially in early-stage startups or funded companies) are filled **privately** via:

- **Referrals**
- **Talent networks**
- **Direct recruiter outreach**

Want to access those hidden networks?
