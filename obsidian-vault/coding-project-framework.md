# 🚀 Project Planning Framework

A clear, step-by-step guide to take an idea from concept to deployable software.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Identify Your Goals

- Why am I making this project?
- Who is this project for?
- What is going to make it valuable?

---

## 👤 Step 2: Write a User Story (User-Centric Design)

Define **exactly what a user should be able to do**, and how the app will serve them.

### Examples:
- User can upload a file.
- User can create an account.
- User can view a dashboard.

---

## 🧱 Step 3: Define Your Data Models

- What information do I need to store?
- How is it related to other data?
- What do those relationships look like?

---

## 🛠️ Step 4: Nail an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- Do I absolutely need this feature for the app to function? (If **no**, remove it.)
- What actually matters?
- What gets me to a working prototype *fast*?

---

## 🖊️ Step 5: Draw a Stupid-Simple Prototype

Sketch a **very basic wireframe** of the app.

- How does the login form work?
- What happens after someone uploads a file?
- How do users navigate between pages?

---

## 🔮 Step 6: Understand the Project’s Future

- Is this a weekend project?
- Is this meant to scale over weeks or months?
- Is it just a hobby project?
- Will this have real users?

---

## 🧩 Step 7: Drill into the Specific Components (Architecture)

### Core Essential Components:
- Browser extension?
- Local script?
- Web service?
- Runs locally?
- Backend API?
- Frontend interface?
- Mobile app?

---

## 🧱 Step 8: Pick a Stack

- What is the **best stack** for this project?
- What is the **simplest stack** within my skill set?
- Can I **deploy** it?

---

## 🔄 Step 9: Overall Development Process

1. **Create a project skeleton**
   - Basic folder structure
   - Development environments
   - Version control setup
2. **Set up the database** and create models
3. **Build backend routes**
   - API endpoints (and test them)
4. **Build the frontend interface**
   - Connect to backend
   - Focus on good UX/UI
5. **Iterate on the project**
   - Gradually add features
   - Test as I go
   - Deploy early and often (even if it's not 100%)
6. **Add automated deployments and testing** (if necessary)
